<p>Hey my name is David, my pronouns are He/him. A bit of a description about me is that I like to snowboard, play video games, workout, sunbathe, and I've video edited for <strong>7 years.</strong> Something I am wanting to get out of this class is that I want to learn more about coding but in a different way than <em>Comp Foundations.</em> I found out that I didn't really like the actual coding aspect of things too much so I hope to get a different perspective in this class.</p>
